### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
Hi Carlo,

I hope you had a nice weekend! I hate to be such a pest, but my client is still very interested in acquiring your Github handle github.com/nutrient so they can use that username. 

In an effort to move things forward, I have been authorized to offer you $500 USD for the account. Would you be willing to sell the account for this price? I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely,
Jordan Chatham, jchatham@marksmen.com
